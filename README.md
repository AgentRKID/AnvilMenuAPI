# AnvilMenuAPI

### Versions
- 1.8

Other versions might be supported in the feature
(Mind you this is spigot version, versions in general should be 
handled fine by Via or other connection libraries.)

### Client Versions
- 1.8+

1.7 doesn't support the way we get the output (This was intentionally made for 1.8+ anyways)
